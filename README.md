# Root cause analysis with big data
1. Built a data ETL pipeline in Python integrated with Spark, SQL Server, HBase, Hive and Teradata to ingest raw datasets and form an efficient pandas dataframe for root cause analysis implementation.
2. Developed an integrated analysis module to rank all the potential root causes by time-weighted correlation, perform special domain knowledge checking like experienced humans, and re-train ranking models with past feedback provided by end-users continuously and automatically.
3. Proposed a heuristic method for curve trend detection and time series forecasting aimed to reduce false alarms using t-test, ARIMA model and linear regression under scikit-learn resulting in 75 percent of false alert removal.
